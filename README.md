**Enhancing LinkedIn Services through Data Structures and Algorithms**
* * *

## üåü Introduction 

  LinkedIn[[1]](https://www.linkedin.com/) is a platform designed for professionals to connect and network within the business community. Established in 2002, the platform serves as a hub for professionals to engage with former and current coworkers, expand their professional network, collaborate within their field, exchange business concepts, explore job opportunities, and recruit potential employees. This project's portfolio delves into how utilizing data structures and algorithms can greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LinkedIn, utilizing skills and knowledge from the Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS) course.

This portfolio showcases how LinkedIn can be significantly improved by enhancing recommendation systems, refining search algorithms, and addressing other key functionalities. Every scenario connects theory to real-world business problems, demonstrating how advanced algorithms can enhance LinkedIn's performance, reliability, and efficiency.

## üíº Need of Portfolio

  An important portfolio that targets LinkedIn is needed to handle the difficult task of improving a professional networking platform by using data structures and algorithms (DSA). Improving features like search algorithms, recommendation systems and network analysis can greatly enhance user interaction and contentment. This portfolio connects academic learning with practical implementation by using theoretical knowledge from DSA and APS courses in real-world situations. It demonstrates not just the capability to address practical issues but also shows dedication to enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of LinkedIn services, making it a valuable resource for professional growth and innovation in the tech sector.

## üóÑÔ∏è Design

  LinkedIn[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn) has over 930 million users in 200 countries. At peak load, the site is serving nearly 5 million user profile pages a second (a user‚Äôs profile page lists things like their job history, skills, recommendations, cringy influencer posts, etc.)

The workload is extremely read-heavy, where 99% of requests are reads and less than 1% are writes (you probably spend a lot more time stalking on LinkedIn versus updating your profile).

To manage the increase in traffic, LinkedIn incorporated Couchbase (a distributed NoSQL database) into their stack as a caching layer. They‚Äôve been able to serve 99% of requests with this caching system, which drastically reduced latency and cost.

LinkedIn[[3]](https://blog.quastor.org/p/linkedin-serves-5-million-user-profiles-per-second) stores the data for user profiles (and also a bunch of other stuff like InMail messages) in a distributed document database called Espresso (this was created at LinkedIn). Prior to that, they used a relational database (Oracle) but they switched over to a document-oriented database for several reasons‚Ä¶.

**1. Horizontal Scalability**
  Document databases are generally much easier to scale than relational databases as sharding is designed into the architecture. The relational paradigm encourages normalization, where data is split into tables with relations between them. For example, a user‚Äôs profile information (job history, location, skills, etc.) could be stored in a different table compared to their post history (stored in a user_posts table). Rendering a user‚Äôs profile page would mean doing a join between the profile information table and the user posts table.

**2. Schema Flexibility**
  LinkedIn wanted to be able to iterate on the product quickly and easily add new features to a user‚Äôs profile. However, schema migrations in large relational databases can be quite painful, especially if the database is horizontally sharded.
On the other hand, document databases are schemaless, so they don‚Äôt enforce a specific structure for the data being stored. Therefore, you can have documents with very different types of data in them. Also, you can easily add new fields, change the types of existing fields or store new structures of data.

### Scalability Issues with Espresso
  LinkedIn migrated off Oracle to **Espresso** in the mid-2010s and this worked extremely well. They were able to scale to 1.4 million queries per second by adding additional nodes to the cluster.

![Espresso Architectur](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/504e325d-23d6-49b3-b67a-e907cb888ca0/EspressoArc.png)

However, they eventually reached the scaling limits of Espresso where they couldn‚Äôt add additional machines to the cluster. In any distributed system, there are shared components that are used by all the nodes in the cluster.
In Espresso‚Äôs case, the shared components are
- Routing Layer - responsible for directing requests to the appropriate storage node
- Metadata Store - manages metadata on node failures, replication, backups, etc.
- Coordination Service - manages the distribution of data and work amongst nodes and node replicas.

LinkedIn reached the upper limits of these shared components so they couldn‚Äôt add additional storage nodes. Resolving this scaling issue would require a major re-engineering effort. Instead, the engineers decided to take a simpler approach and add **Couchbase** as a caching layer to reduce pressure on Espresso.

### Couchbase
  **Couchbase** is a combination of ideas from Membase and CouchDB, where you have the highly scalable caching layer of Membase and the flexible data model of CouchDB. It‚Äôs both a key/value store and a document store, so you can perform Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) operations using the simple API of a key/value store (add, set, get, etc.) but the value can be represented as a JSON document. With this, you can access your data with the primary key (like you would with a key/value store), or you can use N1QL (pronounced nickel). This is an SQL-like query language for Couchbase that allows you to retrieve your data arbitrarily and also do joins and aggregation.

### LinkedIn‚Äôs Cache Design
  When the Profile backend service sends a read request to **Espresso**, it goes to an Espresso Router node. The Router nodes maintain their own internal cache (check the article for more details on this) and first try to serve the read from there.

If the user profile isn‚Äôt cached locally in the Router node, then it will send the request to **Couchbase**, which will generate a cache hit or a miss (the profile wasn‚Äôt in the Couchbase cache). **Couchbase** is able to achieve a cache hit rate of over 99%, but in the rare event that the profile isn‚Äôt cached the request will go to the Espresso storage node.

For writes (when a user changes their job history, location, etc.), these are first done on Espresso storage nodes. The system is eventually consistent, so the writes are copied over to the Couchbase cache asynchronously.

In order to minimize the amount of traffic that gets directed to Espresso, LinkedIn used three core design principles
- Guaranteed Resilience against Couchbase Failures
- All-time Cached Data Availability
- Strictly defined SLO on data divergence

LinkedIn's scalable caching architecture, combining Espresso and Couchbase, efficiently serves millions of users. This design ensures high availability, resilience, and rapid data access while maintaining strict consistency standards.
